Priority:

CURRENTLY: server works on localhost, but cannot get it to work using mongodb atlas - returns 404 when sign up, login etc

Something to do with the atlas connection - it's not working. Maybe create a new one, test in with the localhost running

Then quit the localhost server and check if it working.


Create a .env file, pass all private content into there

Set up mongo and stripe ready for deployment

Create a .gitignore
